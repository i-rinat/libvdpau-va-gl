About
=====

Briefly, this is the [VDPAU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU) driver with
[VA-API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API)/OpenGL backend.

There are applications exists that can use VDPAU. Amongst them Adobe Flash Player
and Mplayer. They both can use VDPAU, but since there is no VDPAU available on Intel
chips, they fall back to different drawing techniques. And while Mplayer can use
XVideo extension to offload scaling to GPU, Flash Player can not and does all
scaling in software. If there was VDPAU available, CPU usage could be significantly
lower.

VDPAU is not vendor-locked technology. Even official documentation mentions
possibility of other drivers. They should be named as `libvdpau_drivername.so.1` and
placed where linker could find them. `/usr/lib` usually works fine.
Which driver to use determined by X server default settings or `VDPAU_DRIVER`
environment variable.

Here is one. Named libvdpau_va_gl.so.1, it uses OpenGL under the hood to
accelerate drawing and scaling and VA-API (if available) to accelerate video
decoding. For now VA-API available on some Intel chips, and on some AMD video
adapters with help of [xvba-va-driver](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/vaapi/xvba-driver/).
OpenGL available, you know, on systems with OpenGL available.


Install
=======
   1. `sudo apt-get install libvdpau-dev libva-dev libglib2.0-dev libswscale-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`
   2. `mkdir build; cd build`
   3. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
   4. `sudo make install`
   5. Add `VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl` to your environment

Run time configuration
======================
Besides `VDPAU_DRIVER` variable which selects which driver to use there are other
variables that control runtime behavior of va_gl driver.

`VDPAU_LOG` enables or disables tracing. `0` disables, `1` enables.

`VDPAU_QUIRKS` contains comma-separated list of enabled quirks. Here is the list:

   * `XCloseDisplay`	Disables calling of XCloseDisplay which may segfault on systems with some AMD cards
   * `ShowWatermark`	Enables displaying string "va_gl" in bottom-right corner of window
   * `LogThreadId`		Adds thread id to trace output
   * `LogCallDuration`	Adds call duration to trace output
   * `LogPqDelay`	Adds presentation queue introduced delay to trace output
   * `AvoidVA`          Makes libvdpau-va-gl NOT use VA-API

Parameters of VDPAU_QUIRKS are actually case-insensetive.
